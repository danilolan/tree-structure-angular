## Future Features
This project was made in a half of a day because the short time frame given by this challenge: 
https://netdeal.com.br/teste-pratico-frontend. All the required features in this link was provided but I'll list above some features that could be implemented for better performance and usability:

Because of that some features that could be included was not:
- Part of the "Quer fazer algo al√©m?" in the challenge link. (Indeterminate checkboxes based on the sons and parents)
- A better and performer way to save the data in localStorage like some ORM or dependency
- A better way to load and edit the tree's nodes like QuadTrees or UnionFind algoritms.
- A button to collapse all the nodes closing them
- A better interface (UI/UX)
